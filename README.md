This program shows how to run a program to blink a led light using nodemcu and Arduino Ide.
components:
    1-Node mcu
    2-Bread Board
    3-Jumper Wires
    4-Arduino ide on computer system
    5-Led light
    6-Usb cable
Basically this helps for home applicants like automatic sensors and iot projects and automatic lights etc
The code is given in the file that I have given.
Steps:-
First we setup the breadband with the mcu then set the connection for ground and another one for the power supply by which you give the command(For example I used D7 in the given code.
After that we run the program then will the microprocessor will store the data and will be run and the light will blink.
Also I'm giving the code for another output by which,at first the program will execute normal light blinking for 5 times then the another operation will execute which I have placed in D4.
Enjoy the code.
